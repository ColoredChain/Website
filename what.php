                        ColoredChain is a fully new decentralized blockchain applications platform with many creative features,
                        powered proof of stake consensus algorithm,masterchina and sidechain architecture,3 level decentralized application framework,trim.	
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With coloredchain,users and developers can create decentralized applications on their own sidechains easily through the 3 level dapps deployment framework. 
                    <p>
                    </p>
                        No ming,no inflation,lightweight,and itâ€™s also suitable well to run nodes on multi-devices with trim feature,including VPS,PC,even smartphone and raspberry pi.

                    <p>
                        <b>Powered Proof of Stake</b> &nbsp; Coloredchain uses virtual powered proof of stake mining to secure the p2p network,no special minning equipment required,no mining cost,no inflation,environment friendly.
                        <br> &nbsp; - Virtual Proof of Power for securing network.
						<br> &nbsp; - Power Transfer for lending power online nodes for securing system.
						<br> &nbsp; - Counterparty economic disincentivizes for anti-Nothing at Stake potential attack.

                    <p>
                        <b>Masterchina and Sidechain</b> &nbsp; The masterchain and sidechain architecture provides more flexible,scalable,clear framework to develop and deploy applications easily.
                    </p>
		    <p>
                        <b>Decentralized Application Framework</b>&nbsp;  Coloredchain will build in 3 level framework for developing,deploying and using decentralized applications.
						<br> &nbsp; - Modularized toolkit for developing DApps.
						<br> &nbsp; - Vitual Machine named CVM to provide a runtime environment for DApps.
						<br> &nbsp; - Plugin kit for installing DApps.
                    </p>
					<p>
                        <b>First DApp case:Colored Token Platform</b>&nbsp;  Coloredchain will also pre-build in a decentralized application - colored token platform,allows users to create and exchange digital assets globally.
                    </p>
		    <p>
                        <b>Trim</b>&nbsp;  The Masterchain and Sidechain architecture allows to trim transactions of sidechains,and dramatically decreases the size of blockchain database, makes it possible to run nodes on most mobile devices,like smartphone,and IOT area.

					<p>
                        <b>Mint</b>&nbsp;The total amount of tokens is fixed,so nodes can only collect transaction fees during process of securing network.
                    </p>
					<p>
                        <b>Fee</b>&nbsp;Transactions will have dynamic transaction fee structure,and the system will automatically recommend the transaction fees according to transaction type and speed.
                        The fee on masterchain will be denominated by masterchain tokens. Fee on sidechains will be denominated by meta tokens of each sidechain respectively.   
                        Masterchain tokens and sidechains tokens can be converted with internal exchange at a market driven price at any time.

                    </p>
		            <p>
					    Coloredchain aims to be a public blockchain applications platform with many creative features and scalability.
                        And with more decentralized applications built on coloredchain,such as colored token platform,the first dapp built in coloredchain,which expects to be used by financial area for issuing and trading digital assets,shares,forex,precious metals,oils,and so on.
                    </p>
					<p>
					    With decentralized application framework,many other dapps can be easily created and deployed,like smart contracts,name system,voting system,decentralized storage,message,lottery,and so on, all of these will make blockchain ecosystem more colorful !
                    </p>
					<p>
					    And with flexibility,scalability and lightweight,coloredchain will also be one of the best solutions for internet of thing(IOT) economy area.
